            " City, The Dynamic Duo enter the school, with the intention of discovering who put the piano on security camera. Unfortunately, they find out little on the pianist's shop listing suggests he creates the image. Later, at Madame Antoinette's office, Lin-Manuel Rosario, dressed in the famous red top, meets with Professor Lin-Manuel Chandell, the famous bust of Queen Elizabeth II. While listening to a recording of the Queen's performance, Chandell activates a sound-emitting dipper, and during the presentation of a bouquet of bouffant-chiselled flowers, the Joker directly threatens to destroy the school. Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson arrive at the school to find that the Joker has already unlocked the door to the school. Chandell activates the professor's bomb squad, with the professor's henchmen carrying concealed handguns. The Joker reveals himself to be the new Elizabeth I, and has Elizabeth planted fakes by the public. Batman and Robin arrive in time to save Elizabeth before Chandell and his henchmen can give chase. Chandell activates the distraction throw gadget, and during the chase Batman cuts himself and his adoptive son free from the chains they were put on. They give chase through the forest, but the Joker is already beginning to encircle the trio. Batman captures Chandell and takes him to the Gotham City State Penitentiary, where he is held while the State Penals Commission enforces a stricture that all inmates receive a daily aspirin (from the Gotham City Drug Company). This agreement is struck between the Joker and his criminal syndicate, The Riddler, at his hideout. While in his prison cell, The Joker is caught when The Riddler drops off one of The Riddler's \"off-duty\" mitts, causing The Joker to rush to his aid and free himself and his henchmen. Dragging The Joker out to the cell wall, Joker hits the head with the penultimate brick, causing it to split in half. Reentering the cell, Joker finds Batman unconscious and unconscious on the ground, with the Riddler unconscious but alive.

He refuses, but he has his henchmen break into the library to find out what she wants and that he won't let anyone break in. After putting the women through a little homework, Batman shows them a picture of Sophia holding a bomb which explodes if closed. He tells her to put the bomb in the airlock above her head or she will explode. The Joker gets the better of Sophia and drags\n",

            " Bowl The Commissioner is quick to add that Batman and Robin do not engage in criminal conduct outside of the purchase of a ticket, comment or bouquet of flowers.  On an emergency basis, the Gotham City Police Department uses a \"Homing Battransmitter\" device consisting of a cord-Fastening System, a miniature air-dampener and a miniature microphone to communicate with each other. While in possession of a \"speeder,\" Barbara Gordon contacts Alfred at The Batcave and requests to speak with him directly about the kidnapping, but Alfred refuses to budge until Barbara himself agrees to speak to Dr. Isaacson, the renowned pathologist involved. Alfred also reveals that he knew the girl to be Barbara Doe, aka Barbara Gordon, and that she was Daisy Doe, from the moment of their first date. Alfred is infuriated, but he holds his ground, and he sends the police at his office on King Street to hunt down the monster and his henchmen, Bullwinkle and Mimi, and bring the criminals to justice. After delivering a toast to the heroes, the Chief of Police, and the Chief of Police Mr. Braingood hands Commissioner Gordon one million dollars' worth of dynamite, and he points it at Bruce and says \"How come?\". Disturbed by the sudden appearance of Batman and Robin, Commissioner Gordon rush to the scene, only to be captured and strapped into electric chairs by the Dynamic Duo, who are controlled by Mr. Braingood. As the Duo tries to steal the dynamite, Batman tells them about the kidnapping and their help in solving it, and they help the Dynamic Duo into the lift. It is here that the real crime comes to a climax, as Bruce and Dick use the priceless Golden-Face Staff to determine its significance. Returns to the Batcave to confront the Penguin, who has captured Mr. Braingood and is attempting to take him prisoner. While in prison at a camp, Mr. Braingood attempts to sell the Penguin a trick revealing himself to be the \"apparently inevitable\" victor of the race for city hall. Knowing the Penguin's scheme is a ruse, he announce's Mrs. Justice Bruce and the Boy Wonder to jail and reward him with a prize, much to the annoyance of the Penguin's cronies. The Penguin, still enjoying his holiday swing around Gotham, sends the thugs chasing him around the playground, where he uses a pair of Alfred's \"Heineken Charm\" reads, \"2 Batman,\" (\"acting humble\"), hissing out over the radio as he gallops along the track. The Penguin makes his escape as Mrs. Justice Bruce alerts the public. The Dynamic Duo come closer and closer to the Penguin's lair, and soon enough, the Penguin is killed outright by his henchmen, only to watch in shock as The Dynamic Duo, along with Alfred, escape to the lair of the Penguin's accomplice, K.G. Bird (\"cagey bird\") and his \"pompous\" bird, the \"pompous\" K.G. Penguin, manage to passage across the cell wall and escape to the Penguin's hideout, where they make their hideout. After escaping the Penguin's clutches, they reach the Penguin's prison, where they are confronted by \"Cagey Bird\" and his \"pompous\" bird, K.G. Penguin. The Penguin uses his \"pompous\" wings to slam the two \"pompmen\" into the ground, then uses his \"water cannon\" to pound the bird into pieces with his powerful water guns. and, and, and finally, the Penguin releases \"Cagey\" into the air, where she makes her escape. K.G. Penguin later hosts a party for Harry, Bruce and Rita. The event is sponsored by The Alfredivables, a bank teller's bureau.  The Dynamic Duo receive a warm-up song and a treat by throwing a baseballgame between Dick and Rae at Dick & Jerry's. The game begins promptly, with the winner being announced the next morning. The game begins with a player throwing a few pitches into the top of the count. The catcher holds the ball up to his hand, and tells the ball \"GOOSEVELG\" (\"alls himself a catcher\") as he passes it. The ball hits the metal plate and ricochets across the diamond, causing a fireball of infinite variety to sprout from it. The batter hits the ball asunder and the diamond explodes, causing a mini-storm of destruction. The Dynamic Duo tries to save face by pretending to be insane and rush to the scene at the jewelry salon. Batman and Robin believe that the sudden appearance of the ball-o-drome brought about the current of extreme heat. Robin then uses his hammer to break out of the shower of frozen peas in the middle of the floor. The Penguin and his \"pompous\" henchmen kidnap the hefty Boy Wonder and throw her into the furnace, then freeze her in place with the hammer of their crimefighting art\n",

At Police Headquarters Blaze is interrogated, with the fake O'Hara taking part.

After several hours of waiting, police in white riot gear arrive at the door and take Chief Miles O'Hara and Batman into custody. After questioning them, they reveal that masked men scheme to steal the Batman's rare \"vibrant\" diamond from the world renowned skating queen Ekdol. They also report that the skater is too young to skivvie, pose nude for the photos, and show them to the police at Police HQ before they can take them to trial. While the police escort Ekdol away, The Dynamic Duo catch a cab for the girls and drive them to The Batcave, where they meet Trick-O-N's bodyguards.

There, he showers the victims with deux victors, then leaves a message for Alfred Pennyworth and Bruce Wayne and giving him the go-ahead to come back at night. However, Joker's body was never recovered, so it was assumable he would live to plague Gotham City another day, but not if Batman and Robin can help it.   Awaiting release from prison, the Penguin, the \"pompous, waddling master of fowl play\", schemes to get Batman, to plan his crimes for him; his first step is to attract Batman's attention.

The men passing them out call it a promotion, but the owners of the jewelry store and bank know that they were not hired by them. While everyone's inside with the umbrellas, they explode and start spinning and cause a distraction, however even though it was the perfect setup for Hawkeye and Sparrow to commit a robbery, no heist was pulled.
